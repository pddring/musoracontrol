# musoracontrol
Musora control chrome plugin

I often play along to a pianote or drumeo activity but find it irritating having to stop playing to move the mouse from one side of the screen to the other to click on play/pause and next / previous activity. This plugin connects an arduino / micropython device as a remote control. I'm using a badger2040, but any device that sends the commands 'next', 'previous' or 'play' over the serial port will work.
